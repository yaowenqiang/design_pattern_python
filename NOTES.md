# SOLID

Design Pattern Classification

+ Creational
  + Object creation
+ Structural
  + Object composition
+ Behavioral
  + Object communication and responsibility

## Single Responsibility Principle

A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

## Open/Closed Principle

Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

## Liskov Substitution Principle

Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.

## Interface Segregation Principle

Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

## Dependency Inversion Principle

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g. interfaces). Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
